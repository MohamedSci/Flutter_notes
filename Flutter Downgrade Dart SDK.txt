Step 1:
If you have a Zip file of pervios Flutter version.
Add its path in >>File>>Setting>>languages and Framework>>(1)Dart ..."...\flutter\bin\cache\" (2).Flutter "....\flutter"


Step 2:
Flutter is versioned using git. Changing the Flutter version is as simple as changing git branch.

There are 2 different ways:

    flutter channel <branch> (example: flutter channel stable)

This command is used to change between branches â€“ usually stable/dev/beta/master. We can also put a specific commit id from git.

    flutter downgrade <version> (example: flutter downgrade v1.2.1)

This command will use a specific version number. You can have the list of the available version numbers using flutter downgrade or here

After this, run any Flutter command (such as flutter doctor), and Flutter will take care of downloading/compiling everything required to run this version.
